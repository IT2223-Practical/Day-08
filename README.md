## bubbleSort.m

This code implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.

### How Bubble Sort Works:

Repeatedly steps through the array.

Compares adjacent elements (arr(j) and arr(j+1)).

Swaps them if they are in the wrong order (i.e., the first is greater than the second).

After each outer loop iteration, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.

## insertionSort.m

This code implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort the array arr in ascending order.

### How Insertion Sort Works:

Starts from the second element and assumes the first element is already sorted.

Stores the current element as key.

Compares key with the previous elements:

If any previous element is greater than key, shift it one position to the right.

Insert key into its correct position.
